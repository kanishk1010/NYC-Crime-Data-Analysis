To run our code, please begin by downloading the NYPD crime data (2006-2016) available at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i.
Any .py scripts should be run using PySpark with the path to the downloaded file as the first and only argument.
Any .ipynb notebooks should be opened in Jupyter Notebook.
